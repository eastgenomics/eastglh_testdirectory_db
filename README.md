## EastGLH Test Directory Database

This repo contains utilities for querying and managing the EastGLH Test Database.

### Set up
To keep your dependencies isolated and the project environment clean, it's recommended to use a virtual environment.
Follow the steps below to get started.

1. Create a virtual enviroment 

```
python -m venv venv
```
This will create a new directory called `venv/` containing the isolated Python environment.

2. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On macOS/Linux
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows (Command Prompt)
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
You should see (venv) at the beginning of your shell prompt, indicating the environment is active.

3. Install Project Requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary Python packages as listed in the requirements.txt file.
